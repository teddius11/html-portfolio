<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Tanapon Boonchuaysream and I am from Thailand. I am currently a business owner of a Korean restaurant and cafe.</p>

<p>I found my interest in coding after playing one of my favourite games of all time: Claire Obscur - Expedition 33. It inspired me how a small studio of around 33 people could create such a complex game. </p>
